**Problem Statement:**

This project enables companies to maintain location wise their cellular (optical fibre cable) mounted information easily, save the time for workers to find cellular hub and update the report, companies can easily review the repair information and take decision in where in the world. Cellular companies can set geo location (longitude / latitude) for (OFC) cable line. Share the (OFC) hub location to workers. Workers need to update repair information. Compare previous repair details to solve problem. Companies can view repair information and problem statement. Reminds companies to change expire cable components.

**Objective of Project:**

•	Cellular companies can set geo location (longitude / latitude) for (OFC) cable line.

•	Share the (OFC) hub location to workers.

•	Workers need to update repair information.

•	Compare previous repair details to solve problem.

**pre requirements**

HTML

CSS

Bootstrap

Xampp Server

PHP

**Functional Requirements**

**•	Login / registration (worker / companies)**

In this module cellular companies need to login by filling their details 
and generate login code for workers, cellular admin needs to login for operate this application.

**•	Update Geo location (longitude and latitude) of cable hub and cable route line**

Cellular company admin needs to assign a geo location of optical fibre cable line mounted on earth. Admin can also add exact longitude and latitude location for hub and routers.

**•	Share problem occurred (OFC) hub location to workers**

Cellular admin can share problem occurred location information to worker by doing this it helps to easily share the find the exact location by workers and saves the time for worker. In some important situation like natural calamities, flood or any this happened in OFC located region, when that time it is easy to find the OFC line location and hub.

**•	Update repair details**

Once worker find the OFC line or hub, they need to update the solution statement or repair details by filling proper details.

**•	View previous repair details**

In this module worker can easily view the previous repair or service details occurred on specific location. It helps to preview the details and compare that to find solution it also helps for companies to get report on what are all problem occurred details and repair information.

**•Expired Components reminder**

Once user mount new component he needs to update expire and replacement details, it helps for companies easy to take decision and replacement process, system will notify the expired and replacement details 

**•	View category wise problem statements and repaired information**

Cellular company can easily generate report on problem statement, area wise, hub wise, and router wise. It helps for the companies to get statistical report.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

**•	 Availability:**

The degree to which a system, subsystem or equipment is in a specified operable and committable state at the start of a mission, when the mission is called for at an unknown, i.e., a random, time. Simply put, availability is the proportion of time a system is in a functioning condition. 
This is a Web application and will be available for the companies whenever they want to use. 

**•	Maintainability:**

Maintainability is a characteristic of design and installation, expressed as the probability that an item will be retained in or restored to a specified condition within a given period of time, when the maintenance is performed in accordance with prescribed procedures and resources.
The project is developed using an Open-source tool and is easy to maintain. By using Google map API easy to locate exact location information.

**•	Security:**

Security is one or more requirements about protection of your system and its data. The measurement can be expressed in a variety of ways like effort, skill level, time etc. to break into the system. 
This feature is provided by having user authentication i.e., providing the user with login-id and password.

**•	Reliability:**

Reliability is a requirement about how often the software fails. The measurement is often expressed in mean time between failures. The definition of a failure must be clear. Also, don't confuse reliability with availability which is quite a different kind of requirement.  Be sure to specify the consequences of software failure, how to protect from failure, a strategy for error detection, and a strategy for correction. The project maintains data integrity. Database crashes and misuse may affect a user’s history.

**•	Simplicity:**

this project developed with rich graphical user interface is help to access application easily and by using Google map API easy to locate exact location of optical fibre and router information.

**Existing System**

In existing system cellular companies mounted stone or any other landmark for to find location of optical fibre cable line, during flood or natural calamities there is difficult to find   there is no proper maintenance of the repair information, sometimes it difficult find fault and solutions for the problem, worker need to contact specialist. Companies facing the problem of cellular devices expire information.

**Proposed System**

In this application enables companies to update geo location for cellular cable hub and also keep track the geo location, it helps for workers to identify the hub locations easily, if any natural calamities like flood earth quake and other problems cellular company can easily identify the optical fibre cable lines. If any fault and other problem occur in cable hubs workers can easily find out the hub location and update the repair details, workers can easily compare the previous repair information to solve the problem. Cellular companies can view the all-cable hub repair status region wise and problem statement wise. Our applications also remind to company’s regard expire information about cable components.

**Application Modules **

	Login / registration (worker / companies)

	Update Geo location (longitude and latitude) of cable hub and cable route line

	Share problem occurred (OFC) hub location to workers

	Update repair details

	View previous repair details 

	Expired Components reminder 

	View category wise problem statements and repaired information

It is the home page of optical cellular service network.it provides platform for cellular companies to easily find the location and collect the details of router and hub .it can be modified and updated and also helps in view the existing update and repair details. the front-end HTML, CSS   AND BOOTSTRAP and middle layer is PHP and back end is MYSQL. Bootstrap and   CSS help to build a better website.

**Sign up form for cellular company**
